        <span class="span--sobre">SOBRE A MÚSICA</span>  
        <div class="container--sobre">   
            <p class="p--desc">Timeless, lançado em 27 de setembro de 2024, é uma colaboração dinâmica com Playboi Carti, combinando o estilo melódico e introspectivo de The Weeknd com a energia vibrante de Carti. A música traz uma atmosfera de escapismo e celebração de momentos fugazes. Com um lyric video lançado no mesmo dia e o videoclipe oficial estreando três dias depois, Timeless expandiu o alcance do álbum com uma sonoridade única que reflete o contraste entre os dois artistas.</p>
